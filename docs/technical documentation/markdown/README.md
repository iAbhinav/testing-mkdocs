# Markdown


### Why Markdown

We choose to use markdown (.md) over any other method of writing technical documentation since:
* .md files are universal
* Developers inherently understand to write docs-as-code approach
* Versioning control is possible with GIT
* It is opensource and completely free to use
* is universally accepted in IDEs and repos like github or bitbucket.
* and many more reasons

### Framework

We choose to use [MkDocs](./mkdocs/README.md) as our choice of framework to write markdown, since:
* Almost no learning curve over markdown
  * All the navigation and config is in a single `mkdocs.yml` file
* Can instantly serve static website
* Could build up a static website which could be hosted in no time.
* Very good community support.
